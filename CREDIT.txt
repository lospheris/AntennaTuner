I don't know that this file is explicitly necessary but I am putting it in here 
anyway.
Credits:
1. Johnny McCown: http://www.thinkschematics.com
    For giving me a project to work on.
2. df4or: http://www.plicht.de/ekki/civ/index.html
    Without this guy I doubt I would have been able to get the code to talk
    to the CI-V buss done in a timely manor.
3. Stephanie Maks:  https://github.com/Stephanie-Maks/Arduino-LiquidTWI
    A huge thanks to this woman for making the optimized LiquidTWI Library
    work on arduino 1.0
4. Many:  http://arduino.cc/playground/Code/AvailableMemory
    Thanks a ton to the guys that contributed to this library. I am a crappy
    programmer and often find myself with memory leaks that eat the Arduinos RAM
    until it crashes. This library has pulled my ass out of the fire on a couple
    of occasions.
5.  The people at Arduino: Arduino.cc
    The documentation for the Arduino is amazing, I would be WAY further behind
    where I am if it wasn't for the documentation on the site.
